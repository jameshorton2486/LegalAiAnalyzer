import { createAndDownloadZip } from '@/lib/utils';

// Example usage
const files = [
  { name: 'transcript1.txt', content: 'transcript content...' },
  { name: 'transcript2.txt', content: 'another transcript...' }
];

await createAndDownloadZip(files);To create your application on Replit, here’s a detailed prompt and step-by-step approach to proceed with your idea:

Prompt for the Application
"Build a web-based application that allows users to upload legal deposition transcripts in text format. The application should utilize AI to review the transcript and suggest follow-up questions for the attorney conducting the deposition. Additionally, users should be able to upload multiple transcripts from the same case, and the AI should compare them to identify contradictions or inconsistencies between witnesses. The platform must prioritize data security and allow users to download AI-generated insights."

Steps to Proceed
1. Set Up Your Replit Environment
Create an Account: Sign up for a Replit account if you don’t already have one.

Start a New Project: Click on "Create Repl" and choose a stack like Python (with Flask or FastAPI) for backend development or Node.js if you prefer JavaScript.

Use Replit AI Tools:

Enable Replit’s AI Agent to assist with generating code based on your prompt.

Use the "Start with AI" option to describe your app idea and let it scaffold the project for you.

2. Core Features to Implement
File Upload System:

Allow users to upload transcripts in .txt or .pdf format.

Use libraries like Flask-Uploads (Python) or multer (Node.js) for file handling.

AI-Powered Transcript Analysis:

Integrate an AI model like OpenAI's GPT-4 or Hugging Face models for natural language processing (NLP).

Train or fine-tune the model on legal datasets to ensure it understands legal terminology and context.

Question Suggestion Feature:

Analyze the uploaded transcript using NLP techniques.

Generate intelligent follow-up questions based on gaps or ambiguities in the transcript.

Comparison Across Transcripts:

Use semantic similarity algorithms (e.g., cosine similarity with embeddings) to compare statements across multiple transcripts.

Highlight contradictions or inconsistencies between witnesses.

Secure Data Handling:

Encrypt uploaded files and AI-generated outputs using libraries like cryptography.

Ensure compliance with data privacy standards by implementing secure storage solutions.

Frontend Interface:

Build a simple UI using HTML/CSS/JavaScript or frameworks like React.js.

Include sections for uploading files, viewing AI insights, and downloading results.

3. Tools and Libraries
Backend Development: Flask/FastAPI (Python) or Express.js (Node.js)

AI Integration: OpenAI API, Hugging Face Transformers

Frontend Development: React.js or plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript

File Management: AWS S3, Firebase Storage, or Replit’s built-in storage

Data Security: Use HTTPS, token-based authentication (JWT), and encryption libraries.

4. Iterative Development
Start by implementing one feature at a time (e.g., file upload).

Test each feature thoroughly before moving on.

Use Replit's live collaboration tools if working with a team.

5. Deployment
Deploy the app directly through Replit’s hosting service.

Share the app link with stakeholders for feedback.

This approach leverages Replit's capabilities while ensuring your application meets functional and security requirements. Let me know if you'd like help with any specific part of this process!

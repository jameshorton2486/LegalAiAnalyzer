[The witness was sworn.]

EXAMINATION BY MS. DOE:

Q: Please state your name for the record.
A: John Smith.

Q: Mr. Smith, where do you currently reside?
A: I live at 123 Main Street, Anytown, USA.

Q: How long have you lived there?
A: About five years now.

Q: What is your occupation?
A: I'm a software engineer at Tech Solutions, Inc.

Q: How long have you been employed there?
A: I've been with the company for eight years.

Q: Were you present at the office on January 15, 2023?
A: Yes, I was.

Q: Can you describe what happened that day?
A: I arrived at the office around 8:30 AM as usual. I was working at my desk until about 11:00 AM when I heard a commotion in the hallway. I stepped out to see what was happening and saw Mr. Johnson yelling at Ms. Davis about a project deadline.

Q: Did you hear what was being said?
A: Yes, Mr. Johnson was saying that the project was already two weeks behind schedule and that Ms. Davis was responsible for the delay.

Q: How did Ms. Davis respond?
A: She said that she had informed Mr. Johnson about potential delays three weeks earlier and had documentation to prove it, but he had ignored her warnings.

Q: Was anyone else present during this exchange?
A: Yes, several other employees were in the hallway, including Sarah Wilson and Michael Chen.

Q: Did you see any physical contact between Mr. Johnson and Ms. Davis?
A: No, there was no physical contact. It was just a verbal disagreement.

Q: What happened after that?
A: Mr. Johnson stormed off to his office, and Ms. Davis returned to her desk. The rest of us went back to work.

Q: Did you speak with either Mr. Johnson or Ms. Davis after this incident?
A: Yes, I spoke with Ms. Davis later that afternoon. She seemed upset and mentioned that this wasn't the first time Mr. Johnson had publicly criticized her work.

Q: Did Ms. Davis mention any previous incidents?
A: She mentioned that about a month earlier, during a team meeting, Mr. Johnson had interrupted her presentation and questioned her competence in front of the entire team.

Q: Were you present during that meeting?
A: Yes, I was. I remember Mr. Johnson being somewhat dismissive of her ideas, but I wouldn't characterize it as questioning her competence.

Q: So your recollection differs from Ms. Davis's characterization?
A: Yes, I would say it was more of a professional disagreement rather than an attack on her competence.

Q: Did you ever witness Mr. Johnson behaving similarly with other employees?
A: He has a direct management style and can be quite demanding, but I haven't seen him singling out other employees the way he seemed to with Ms. Davis.

Q: Did you ever discuss this observation with anyone?
A: No, I didn't feel it was my place to get involved in their professional relationship.

Q: Are you aware of any complaints filed by Ms. Davis regarding Mr. Johnson's behavior?
A: I heard rumors that she had spoken to HR, but I don't have any direct knowledge of formal complaints.

Q: When did you hear these rumors?
A: Sometime in February, a few weeks after the incident in the hallway.

Q: From whom did you hear these rumors?
A: I believe it was from Sarah Wilson during a lunch break.

Q: Did Ms. Wilson share any details about the nature of the complaint?
A: She just mentioned that Ms. Davis had gone to HR about feeling targeted by Mr. Johnson. I don't know anything more specific than that.

Q: Did you notice any change in Mr. Johnson's behavior toward Ms. Davis after February?
A: Yes, they seemed to interact less frequently, and when they did, Mr. Johnson was noticeably more formal and less critical.

Q: How would you describe the overall work environment at Tech Solutions?
A: Generally positive. It's a fast-paced environment with high expectations, but most people get along well and collaborate effectively.

Q: Have you witnessed or experienced any discrimination or harassment during your time there?
A: No, I haven't personally experienced or witnessed what I would consider discrimination or harassment.

Q: In your opinion, did Mr. Johnson's treatment of Ms. Davis constitute harassment?
A: I'm not an expert on what legally constitutes harassment. From my perspective, it seemed like a personality conflict and management style issue rather than harassment, but I can understand why Ms. Davis might have felt uncomfortable.

Q: Have you discussed this deposition with anyone prior to today?
A: I spoke briefly with the company's legal counsel last week about the fact that I would be deposed, but we didn't discuss any specifics about what I would say.

Q: Did anyone instruct you on how to answer questions today?
A: No, I was just told to be truthful and answer the questions to the best of my ability.

MS. DOE: I have no further questions at this time.

EXAMINATION BY MR. JOHNSON:

Q: Mr. Smith, you mentioned that you've been with Tech Solutions for eight years. Have you worked directly with Ms. Davis during that time?
A: Yes, we've worked on several projects together over the past four years since she joined the company.

Q: How would you characterize Ms. Davis's work performance?
A: She's generally thorough and competent, but sometimes misses deadlines on complex projects.

Q: Have you ever had any conflicts or disagreements with Ms. Davis?
A: We've had professional disagreements about approach and methodology, but nothing I would characterize as a conflict.

Q: You mentioned that Mr. Johnson had a "direct management style." Could you elaborate on what you mean by that?
A: He's very clear about his expectations, doesn't sugarcoat feedback, and can be quite blunt when projects aren't meeting targets.

Q: Is this management style applied uniformly to all employees or just to Ms. Davis?
A: In my observation, he's fairly consistent in his approach with everyone, but his interactions with Ms. Davis seemed to be more frequent and perhaps more intense.

Q: You stated that you didn't witness any physical contact between Mr. Johnson and Ms. Davis during the January 15 incident. Were you in a position to observe the entire interaction?
A: Yes, I was standing about 10 feet away and had a clear view of both of them throughout the exchange.

Q: How long did this exchange last?
A: Approximately three to five minutes.

Q: During your conversation with Ms. Davis after the incident, did she mention feeling physically threatened by Mr. Johnson?
A: No, she didn't mention feeling physically threatened. Her concerns seemed to be about public criticism and what she perceived as unfair treatment.

Q: Did Ms. Davis ever mention to you that she believed Mr. Johnson's treatment was based on her gender?
A: No, she never explicitly said that to me.

Q: In your eight years at Tech Solutions, have you observed Mr. Johnson treating female employees differently than male employees?
A: I can't say that I've noticed a consistent pattern of different treatment based on gender.

Q: You mentioned that Mr. Johnson's behavior toward Ms. Davis changed after February. Did you ever learn why?
A: No, I wasn't privy to any discussions or decisions that might have led to that change.

Q: Has the overall team dynamic changed since Ms. Davis filed her complaint?
A: There's been some tension, and people seem more cautious in team meetings, especially when both Mr. Johnson and Ms. Davis are present.

Q: Has this affected productivity or morale?
A: I think there's been a slight impact on morale, but I haven't noticed a significant change in productivity.

MR. JOHNSON: Thank you, Mr. Smith. I have no further questions.

MS. DOE: Just a few follow-up questions.

FURTHER EXAMINATION BY MS. DOE:

Q: Mr. Smith, you mentioned that Mr. Johnson's interactions with Ms. Davis seemed more intense compared to others. Can you provide specific examples of this difference?
A: Well, for instance, during team meetings, he would often interrupt Ms. Davis during her presentations, but would let others complete their thoughts before commenting. And he would question her data and assumptions more rigorously than he did with other team members.

Q: Did you ever hear Mr. Johnson make comments about Ms. Davis's appearance or personal life?
A: I recall one instance where he commented that she looked tired and asked if she was "too busy with her social life" to complete a project properly. I don't recall him making similar comments to male colleagues.

Q: Did this comment occur before or after the January 15 incident?
A: It was before, probably in November or December of last year.

Q: Was anyone else present when this comment was made?
A: Yes, it was during a team meeting, so most of our group was there.

Q: How did Ms. Davis respond to this comment?
A: She appeared uncomfortable but maintained her professionalism. She simply stated that she was fully committed to her work and continued with her presentation.

MS. DOE: Thank you. No further questions.
